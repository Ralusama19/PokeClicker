# PokeClicker

Inspired by clicker games like Cookie-Clicker or Monster-Clicker, I made my own Pokemon-Clicker using C++ and SFML.

In this simple game you have to click the big pokeball in order to make your pokemons grow.
As you click, the bars in the game will load. When a berry bar is full you can feed your pokemon: the more berries you feed your pokemon, the faster he'll grow. When a pokemon reaches adulthood you'll release him, and you'll be able to fill the empty slot with a new egg. But don't worry, the memory of your pokemon will be kept in the Pokedex and you'll be able to see it as long as you want.

So, what do you say. Can you hatch them all?
